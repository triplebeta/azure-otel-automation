This is based on this repo: [https://github.com/jordanbean-msft/automation-ado](https://github.com/jordanbean-msft/automation-ado)

The deployment script creates a link between version control and the Automation setup in Azure.
For more details please check the Git repo above.

Perhaps this can also be automated using Terraform since this setup seems a bit complicated.
