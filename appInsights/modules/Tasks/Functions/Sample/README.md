# Fake data and sample queries for workbooks

This folder contains a set of Log Analytics Functions to demonstrate how to use Azure Workbook Templates and Azure Workbooks.

It also contains sample functions to mock data, like the AppTraces table. Those tables contain ficticious Trace lines, lines that would have generated by the solution. This static data allows us to build a Workbook to showcase some of the features.
