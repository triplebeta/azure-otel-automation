# Introduction

This solution shows how you can utilize standard Azure services to monitor a solution perform common maintenance actions. It implements a working solution and deployment is automated as well.

The goal of this showcase is to demonstrate the capabilities and to provide a playground to tinker with it. It can help to learn how to use these concepts.

To understand the concepts of the showcase, please check out [this show case description](docs/Showcase.md). As a next step you can check [the list of components](docs/Components.md). 

NOTE: The sample code can also be used with Databricks. To connect Databricks to Log Analytics, check out this repository: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/databricks-observability](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/databricks-observability)
