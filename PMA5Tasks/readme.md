# Simulator of Tasks component

## Why this simulator

By simulating the setup of 3 chained components (Events, Tasks and States), we can learn how to connect them
and which metrics and logs we need. This tasks component is triggered by an Event Hub message.

It does not actually produce any data, just metrics and log messages. And it can simulate various situations
so we can test how those are reflected in the dashboards.
